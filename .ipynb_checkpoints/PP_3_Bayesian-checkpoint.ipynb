    "Let's recap what we've covered so far to get a better idea of how this all relates to Bayesian inference. In Chapter 1, we introduced the concepts of generative models and applying Bayesian inference. Recall, that we stated that the Bayesian approach can be summarized in five general steps (shown in the figure on the right).  \n",

    "Let's reframe this in the context of human intuition. Bayesian inference can be thought of as using probabilistic intuition to predict an outcome. For instance, returning to the poke <a href='PP_2_Probability.ipynb#ex28'>Example 2.8</a>, let's say you always ask for 8 oz. of poke. However, you've observed that the last five times you bought poke from this shop, they have given you 8.5 oz. instead. From this prior experience, what quantity of poke would you expect to receive the next time you visited this shop and asked for 8 oz. of poke? You would likely reason that you would receive 8.5 oz. of poke, because you got an extra 0.5 oz the last 5 times you visited.\n",

    "Bayesian inference works the same way, using prior knowledge to predict future outcomes. To model the prior and future (posterior) outcomes, we use probability distributions that fit our scenario. These concepts are the key foundations of probabilistic programming. This is modelled mathematically using Bayes Theorem.\n",

    "Bayes Theorem can be reinterpreted for Bayesian inference as follows, where the *posterior distribution*, $P(A|B)$, is what we are trying to solve for given the *prior distribution* $P(A)$, the *likelihood*, $P(B|A)$, and the *model evidence*, $P(B)$. Another way to think about this is to consider $A$ equal to the *hypothesis* and $B$ equal to the *data*, where the data is known, just like Event $B$ was assumed to have already occurred. In other words, Event $A$ is conditional on Event $B$ occurring.\n",

Priors can be classified along a continuum from uniformative to informative.  There are pros and cons for using each type of prior, and the choice of an appropriate prior largely depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve. The degree to which the prior influences the posterior decreases as the sample size increases. \n",

    "## Finding the posterior\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to the HPD incidents <a href='PP_2_Probability.ipynb#HPD'>Example 2.9</a> we introduced before. From Chapter 2 we know how to write the model that describes the experiment in Python as well as understand how Bayesian inference works. But how can one implement inference in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we introduce several types of inference that can be used to find the posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already used one of the inference methods in the Introduction - rejection sampling. Recall, that in order to perform rejection sampling, one generates data and if it coincides with observed data, we keep information about the prior. After repeating the process many times, one has set of priors that generated observed data, i.e. the posterior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although such an algorithm is easy to understand and implement, it is inefficient and impractical: a lot of rejections will take place before a sample that fits observed data is generated. Because of its inefficiency, rejection sampling is not implemented in PyMC3, and we will not discuss this further. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major types of methods of inference (*Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo* (MCMC) and non-MCMC) to determine the posterior distribution. MCMC methods preferentially sample from the areas of a probability distribution with a greater chance of success. This is compared to non-MCMC methods, which do not account for probability in their sampling density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some non-MCMC methods are often too simple to use with complicated problems, but can be useful. One example of a non-MCMC method is grid approximation. Grid approximation is useful in the case of a one-dimensional problem (i.e. our model only has one parameter), but becomes computationally expensive when the model has multiple parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid approximation can be intuitively explained using a grid (or table). Imagine you have a grid that has $n$ boxes, and each one of these initially boxes represents the prior distribution. For instance, for the uniformative prior, these grid boxes would all have the same value. Building on this, each grid box also contains information about the likelihood. To solve for the posterior, the posterior is calculated for each grid box using Bayes Theorem, which arrives at the posterior distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try an example, returning to our HPD incidents problem. We will first solve with grid approximation and then with one of the MCMC algorithms and compare the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would we solve the problem using the grid approximation method?\n",
